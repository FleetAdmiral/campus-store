Should be pretty self explainatory. Lets discuss and start ASAP.
So , stuff we need to do is:
1) Buy section , browse items
2) Sell section : mostly just a bunch of forms  
3) Bid section(proposed , can be changed) : view all items , apply bids
Kitewarrior please append depending on your view , and then we start.

Database :
 Every user has database records to take care of the 'seller' and the 'buyer' part.
